## 🎯 Project Overview

This project aimed to redesign Duolingo's user experience to better support advanced language learners while reducing engagement fatigue caused by repetitive gamification. Through UX research, design thinking, and iterative prototyping, we created solutions that emphasize real-life fluency, personalization, and meaningful engagement.

## 🔍 Problem Statement

Many Duolingo users enjoy the initial gamified learning experience but:
- Feel pressure and burnout from daily streaks and leaderboards
- Struggle to advance beyond basic vocabulary
- Lack opportunities for real-world spoken or written language practice

> **Reframed Design Challenge:**  
> *How might we support advanced language skills like spoken and written communication in an engaging, personalized way while avoiding burnout from over-gamification?*

## 🧪 UX Research Process

- **User Interviews (5+)** – Gathered insights from active learners on frustrations and goals  
- **Competitive & Analogous Analysis** – Compared Duolingo with Babbel, Rosetta Stone, Google Translate, etc.  
- **Persona & Journey Mapping** – Created user personas and mapped their challenges over time  
- **Usability Testing** – Validated feature concepts and early wireframes with real users  
- **Design Principles** – Focused on authenticity, personalization, and skill-building

## 💡 Key Insights

- Users are motivated by real-world goals (travel, career, family) more than streaks
- Gamification becomes repetitive and sometimes discouraging
- There's a strong desire for speaking practice, feedback, and conversation simulation
- Cultural authenticity and tone feedback are underrepresented in current tools

## 🧩 Solution Highlights

- **AI-Powered Conversation Lab** – Simulates real-world scenarios like job interviews or travel  
- **Adaptive Pronunciation Feedback** – Real-time tone, clarity, and grammar suggestions  
- **Smart Streaks** – Customizable pacing to reduce pressure and allow flexible progress  
- **Story-Driven Learning Paths** – Unlock progression through conversations and tasks, not just XP  

## 🎨 Prototype

- Designed low- and mid-fidelity wireframes
- Built interactive prototype in Figma
